François Lamboley <francois.lamboley@happn.com>

A simple SwiftLog-compatible logger designed for Command Line Tools.

== ⚠️ Crippled version for Swift 5.1 and macOS 10.14

The interface on this branch is not exactly the same as in the regular tags.
The SGR cannot be parsed.

== Usage

== Metadata Log Format

The metadata log format is very opinionated:

- Everything is backslashed so as to be able to actually parse the metadata
directly from the output;
- But we assume level0 keys will never contain spaces, or any other weird chars,
and so we do not quote neither backslash level0 keys;
- Keys are sorted in the output, always.

Example of logs:
[code,txt]
----
⚠️ [request_id: "42"] with some metadata
⚠️ [request_id: "42", service_id: "ldap"] with some metadata
⚠️ [faulty_wires: "[\"d\", \"a\", \"oops, has\\\"a quote\"]", request_id: "42", service_id: "ldap"] with some metadata
